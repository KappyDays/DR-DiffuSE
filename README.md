# DR-DiffuSE
This is the repository of: DR-DiffuSE: Denoise and Refine Speech with Diffusion Probabilistic Model, Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2023.

The code will be open source soon after I finish other things at hand...

Since the national project application is concentrated in March, it's relatively busy, and there is no time for me to recheck the code of DR-DiffuSE and open-source it. However, I will take the time to complete the code upload before 22, March...
